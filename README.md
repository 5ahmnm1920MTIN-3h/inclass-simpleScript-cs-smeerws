# inclass-simpleScript-cs-smeerws

### Project description: 
This Unity 2D project serves to practice C# and to repeat C# basics. 
When pressing the subsraction button, the program takes the text from two InputFields (a and b), parse them to int, and substracts b from a.

Windows 10; 
Unity Version: 2019.1.14f1; 
Visual Studio Version: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017, Version 15.9.17;
Scripting Runtime Version: 4.X;

* Nothing needed to run program in Unity


### Third party material: 
(if used Fonts, Sounds, Music, Graphics, Materials, Code etc.)

* None

100%

### Limitations:
* Compile time error when Inputfield is empty
* Reset Button not working

### Lessons Learned:
